    <h5>1/2 a pair of prevarications (disingenuous as requested, doubtless guiltless)
        juxtaposed contra 2 verissimiar variations, verifiable in their verity.</h5>
        <h4> In laymen's terms </h4>
        <h1> 2 truths and 1 Lie</h1>
    <hr />

        <p>Cloaked behind the mystery of the Black Mirror,
        humankind can define truth each as they see fit. Terrifying. Naughty. But also kinda fun.
        Define your own truths below. If you dare.</p>

        <h2> The Vast Horde (or, "Children are a Blessing")</h2>
        <p> I am one of seven siblings - all from the same parents, and this summer 
            we all lived under the same roof. </p>
        <h2> Musical Polymath (or, "Cut it out with all the noize")</h2>
        <p> I've been playing, writing and recording my own music since I was in middle school,
            and as a result I'm proficient on over a dozen instruments, including Drums, Piano, 
            DJ equipment, and Violin.
        </p>
        <h2> Polyglot Alot (or, "Cut it out with all that noize, pt. 2")</h2>
        <p> I am fluent in 4 spoken langauges, and conversational in another 2, including English, 
            German, Dutch, Latin, and Arabic.</p>
